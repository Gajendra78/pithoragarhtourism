									<h4>DELHI TO KATHGODAM BY OVERNIGHT TRAIN</h4>
								</div>
								<div class="trek-content">
									<p>
										Unlike most of our treks which are based in the Garhwal region of Utarakhand,
										this one takes you to the lofty mountains of the Kumayun district. The easiest
										way to get till the base of these mountains is by taking an overnight train from
										Old Delhi Railway station to Kathgodam.
									</p>
									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 01 : </i></span>
										<h4>DRIVE KATHGODAM TO MUNSYARI (280 Km by road):</h4>
									</div>
									<p>It’s with the early morning mist that you arrive at Kathgodam, our vehicles will
										be waiting for you here to take you through a picturesque drive (covering
										Almora, Bageshwar, Chowkri and Tejam) to Munsiyari. You shirk off the journey
										here by getting a sound sleep either at a tent or a rest house.</p>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 02 : </i></span>
										<h4>DAY AT MUNSYARI:</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										Most part of the day is spent in getting some paper work ready to get necessary
										permits from the local administration. The evenings however are free for you to
										see around the very beautiful village.</P>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 03 : </i></span>
										<h4>TREK MUNSYARI TO LILAM VILLAGE (2000m):</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										From Munsyari, a 10 km drive will take you to Selapani from where we begin our
										trail up the hill. This easy 7km walk will take only 2 ½ hours and you will find
										yourself in Lilam in good time to halt at the tiny rest house for the night.</P>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 04 : </i></span>
										<h4>TREK LILAM TO BUGDIAR (2700m - 14 km/7 hrs):</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										From Lilam the trail enters a spectacular 25 km long gorge. Etched into the
										cliff face above the Gori Ganga, the hillsides above are covered in dense bamboo
										thickets and mixed rain forest. After the junction of the Ralam and Gori Ganga
										rivers the trek climbs to a tea shop at Radgari, and then goes to a small rest
										house at Bugdiar (2700 m). Here, there is a memorial which laments the loss of
										life of villagers and army personals in the avalanche of 1989- Today only a few
										houses remain on the edge of a waste land-Perhaps a very horrid reminder of what
										nature’s fury can do to civilizations. Overnight stay in tents/ rest house.</P>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 05 : </i></span>
										<h4>TREK BUGDIAR TO RAILKOT (3200m -16 km/6 hrs):</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										The valley opens up after climbing quite steeply to a huge overhanging cliff,
										which shelters a local deity. The route then enters progressively drier terrain,
										but there are two waterfalls of about 100 m, one of them opposite a tea shop at
										Mapang, where you can rest your weary limbs and take in the limited available
										refreshments. Further trek uphill brings you to Railkot (3200 m).</P>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 06 : </i></span>
										<h4>TREK RAILKOT TO GHANGHAR (3300m -13 km/6 hrs):</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										The land is now almost arid and the villages in passing are nearly deserted till
										you get to Burphu village which is backed by the Burphu peak ( 6300 m ). The
										eastern side of Nanda Devi east comes in to view here while you reach up to
										Ghanghar village (3300 m) where only three of the farmers of 60 families remain
										and the carefully walled fields below are also deserted. In spite of the
										eeriness of this town it is interesting to note the beautifully carved wooden
										doors and windows</P>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 07 : </i></span>
										<h4>TREK GHANGHAR TO THE BASE CAMP (3900m) OF NANDA DEVI EAST (7430m -7 km/3
											hrs):</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										A steep narrow trek leads into the Pachhu valley, dominated by the north face of
										Nanda Devi East 35,00m above the Pachhu glacier. Dwarf rhododendron and birch,
										with anemones and the Primulas below line the first section of the trek before
										it emerges into alpine meadows below the debris of the glacier itself. Tom
										Longstaff came through this valley in his unsuccessful attempt to climb Nanda
										Devi East in 1905 before trying the parallel valley to south of Pachhu via what
										is now known as Longstaff’s Col. There is a camp site (39, 00 m) 3 km from the
										base of Nanda Devi with both the Col and the summit clearly visible; Provided
										the weather is clear.</P>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 08 : </i></span>
										<h4>TREK BASE CAMP TO MILAM VILLAGE (3300 m -17 km/6 hours):</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										Returning via Ghanghar at Burphu, the trek crosses the Gori Ganga on a wooden
										bridge then climbs to the former staging post of Milam village(3,300 m). Now,
										this village where we will stop for an overnight camp was the home of a number
										of renowned Pundit explorers and is also the last major settlement before Tibet.
										However, in spite of the vicinity to Tibet most villagers here trace their
										ancestors to the Rajput clans of the desert state of Rajasthan.</P>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 09 : </i></span>
										<h4>TREK TO MILAM GLACIER VIEW POINT:</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										This excursion (3km: 1 hour) is possible from the Milam village to the Milam
										Glacier (4,100 m). The path can be slippery due to clear ice uncovered by debris
										from earlier treks and one needs to be careful while crossing the left bank of
										this glacier.</P>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 10 : </i></span>
										<h4>TREK MILAM TO RAILKOT (14 km/4-5 hrs):</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										We now start tracking back on our earlier steps, starting with getting back to
										Railkot from Milam.</P>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 11 : </i></span>
										<h4>TREK RAILKOT TO BUGDIAR (16km/ 5-6 hrs):</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										This day is another repeat of our earlier days- Day 5 to be specific and we
										return back to Bugdigar today making our way once more through the deserted
										village of barely 3 farmer families.</P>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 12 : </i></span>
										<h4>TREK BUGDIAR TO LILAM (15KM/ 5-6hrs):</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										This day is a repeat of day 4 and we pass once more through the bamboo thickets
										and dense rain forests, which we did while climbing up to Bugdigar.</P>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 13 : </i></span>
										<h4>TREK LILAM TO ROAD HEAD AND DRIVE TO MUNSYARI (7km PLUS 12km/ 4-5 hrs):</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										We return back to civilization to Munsiyari. Checking preferably into a guest
										house/hotel or maybe another camp for reminisce sake as we make the end of a
										wonderful and exciting trek.</P>
									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 14 : </i></span>
										<h4>DRIVE MUNSYARI TO KATHGODAM (280 km/ 10 hrs):</h4>
									</div>
									<P>
										Back driver to Kathgodam from munsyari and carry back memorable moments.

							<p>This is highly dependent on the seasonal changes. Generally, tourists flock to Ralam in
								the last weeks of April to mid-October. But like I said, this is subject to change
								according to the climatic conditions.</p>
							<p>Mid-March to Mid-June is an ideal time to visit this trek. Weather remains hot during the
								summer season. Monsoon (Mid-June to Mid-September) It's not a good time to visit as the
								trail gets slippery, and trekkers find it tough to make through the route. Spring
								(Mid-September to late October) Weather remains moderate during these months of the
								year. Winter (November to late February) Trekkers can't go for trekking during winter as
								the temperature rolls down in minus and thus, trails remain covered with snow.</p>

								option thereby making it perfect for the solace you are looking for because it is
								situated right in the heart of Himalayas. Peaks of Nanda Devi (7,848 metres), Trishuli
								(7,120 metres) and Nanda Kot (6,861 metres) will be your ally. Namik Glacier is the
								source from where a number of waterfalls and sulphur springs originate. You can also

								eternal beauty of Himalayas through unsoiled villages will put you in a trance. Note:
								Uttarakhand Tourism has announced Namik Glacier as the 'Trek of the year' for the year

								<div class="trek-content">
									<p>
										Unlike most of our treks which are based in the Garhwal region of Utarakhand,
										this one takes you to the lofty mountains of the Kumoun district. The easiest
										way to get till the base of these mountains is by taking an overnight train from
										Old Delhi Railway station to Kathgodam.
									</p>
									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 01 : </i></span>
										<h4>DRIVE KATHGODAM TO MUNSYARI (280 Km by road):</h4>
									</div>
									<p>It’s with the early morning mist that you arrive at Kathgodam, our vehicles will
										be waiting for you here to take you through a picturesque drive (covering
										Almora, Bageshwar, Chowkri and Tejam) to Munsiyari. You shirk off the journey
										here by getting a sound sleep either at a tent or a rest house.</p>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 02 : </i></span>
										<h4>DAY AT MUNSYARI:</h4>
									</div>
									<P> Most part of the day is spent in getting some paper work ready to get necessary
										permits from the local administration. The evenings however are free for you to
										see around the very beautiful village.
									</P>

									<div class=""> <span><i>Day 03 : </i></span>
										<h4>TREK MUNSYARI TO RALAM VILLAGE (50 Km)</h4>
									</div>
									<P>The hikers can rest at the tiny hamlets of Lilam, Panton and Sapa-Odiyar which
										will come on the way. From Ralam village, the hikers will have to cover a
										walking distance of 15 km to reach the glacier.
										And finally you reach the Ralam Village.</P>

									<P>
										Back driver to Kathgodam from munsyari and carry back memorable moments.
