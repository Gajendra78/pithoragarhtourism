    <p>Spring is one of the four conventional temperate seasons, following
      winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions
      of spring, but local usage of the term varies according to local
      climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern
      Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa.
      At the spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately
      twelve hours long, with day length increasing and night length
      decreasing as the season progresses.</p>

    <p> Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling after
      spring and before autumn. At the summer solstice, the days are
      longest and the nights are shortest, with day-length decreasing as
      the season progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning
      of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture. When
      it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the
      Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.</p>

    <p>Autumn, also known as fall in American English and sometimes in
      Canadian English,[1] is one of the four temperate seasons. Autumn
      marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern
      Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the duration of
      daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools down
      considerably. One of its main features is the shedding of leaves
      from deciduous trees.</p>

    </section>
    <p> Spring is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate
      zones (winter does not occur in most of the tropical zone). It
      occurs after autumn and before spring in each year. Winter is caused
      by the axis of the Earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from
      the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of
      winter, and some use a definition based on weather. When it is
      winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern
      Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated
      with snow and freezing temperatures.</p>
