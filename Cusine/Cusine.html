				<h3>Kumaoni Raita</h3>
				<p> After Bhang ki Chutney, Kumaoni raita is hailed for its taste. It’s so simple and hassle free that
					even those who dislike cooking can make it like a pro. Just take some curd, grate a cucumber, add
					some fresh green chillies and mustard seeds to it. Lastly sprinkle some turmeric, salt, red chilli
					powder and garnish it with coriander leaves.
				</p>
				<h3>Ras/Thhatwani</h3>
				<p> This nutritious dish is one of the best things to try in this winter season. Ras/Thhatwani is
					prepared by boiling different types of lentils altogether. These lentils are then skimmed from the
					stock and a fine paste made out of rice is added to it. Once the Ras is cooked, you can serve it
					fresh with white rice. Also, the lentils that were separated from the stock can be munched by
					sprinkling powdered spices on it.
				</p>

					hemp seeds, cumin seeds, garlic leaves, tamarind, and salt. When served with the traditional Pahadi
					cuisines, it enhances their taste and creates a spell on our taste buds.
				</p>
				<h3>Aloo Tamatar ka Jhol</h3>
				<p> This dish may sound like any other Bengali curry dish but it actually traces its origin from
					Uttarakhand. Aloo Tamatar ka Jhol is an easy to cook dish that can be prepared in less than 15
					minutes. All you need to do is boil some potatoes, make a curry out of tomatoes and onions, mix both

					manner in the cities as well as in the villages of Uttarakhand.

					rice. Prepare a dough out of it and make soft round balls. Deep fry the rolls and soak the extra oil
					by using paper towels.
