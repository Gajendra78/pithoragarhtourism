						granite with its white glacial crest, was already a huge, structure even when the Himalayas were
						just beginning to protrude out of the Tethys Sea. The mountain is located near lake manasrovar
						and lake rakshastal close to the source of some of the longest asian rivers: the Indus, Sutlej,
						Brahmaputra, and Karnali also known as Ghaghara (a tributary of the Ganges) in India. Mount
						Kailash is considered to be sacred in four religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Tibetan/Bon.
						In Hinduism, it is traditionally recognized as the abode of Shiva, who resided there along with
						his consort goddess Parvati and their children, Ganesha and Kartikeya. According to jain
						scriptures, Ashtapada is the site where the first Jain Tirthankara, Rishabh deva attained
						moksha(liberation). Mount Kailash is known as Mount Meru in Buddhist texts. It is central to its
						cosmology, and a major pilgrimage site for some Buddhist traditions. Bön a religion native to
						Tibet, maintain that the entire mystical region and Kailash, which they call the "nine-story
						Swastika Mountain", is the axis mundi, Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring. Every year, thousands make a
						pilgrimage to Kailash, following a tradition going back thousands of years. Pilgrims of several
						religions believe that circumambulation Mount Kailash on foot is a holy ritual that will bring
						good fortune.
