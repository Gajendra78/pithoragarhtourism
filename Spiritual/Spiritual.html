					<h2>Om Parvat</h2>
					<p>
						The Adi Kailash Peak is one of the scared peaks in the Indian Himalayan region as the pattern of
						snow deposition on it takes the shape of “OM”. Adi Kailash, also known as Om Parvat, has several
						other names like Little Kailash, Jonglingpong Peak, Baba Kailash and Chhota Kailash. Located on
						its base, Lake Parvati at an altitude of approximately 4,500 meters is often considered as a
						holy lake by several Hindu pilgrims. The trek to Adi Kailash Base Camp traverses through a rich
						valley, which is embellished with several tribal villages, cultivating lands and wide range of
						flora and fauna at different altitude, and cuts through several small streams. Set on a blissful
						and divine journey – The Adi kailash Om Parvat Trek.According to the Hindu mythology, creator of
						the world Lord Shiva is said to be residing on Mount
						Kailash. Hindus all over the world believe there is three Kailash Mountain in the world. The
						first one is called the Kailash Mansarovar or the Greater /Bada Kailash which is in Tibet, the
						second one is called the Adi Kailash or the Chota Kailasha in Uttaranchal and the third one is
						called the Kinnaur Kailash in Himachal Pradesh.
						Every year the Government of India organizes pilgrimage tours to Kailash Mansarovar in
						association with the China government. And on route to Kailash Mansarovar lies the Adi Kailash
						which happens to be near the Sino-Indo border. For those who don't know, majority of the trek is
						along the Kali River. For those who are wondering where does Om Parvat come? Well, Om Parvat
						marks the tri-junction point where borders of Tibet, Nepal and India meet. That's not all, this
						ancient Himalayan peak is breathtakingly beautiful.
